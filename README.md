MESSAGE FROM KYRA: Owen did a great job debugging my frontend code, but then I accidentally deleted it an
hour before we have to submit it, so the app is not running:(
Please look at version history to find frontend that connected with backend. I'm so sorry! And i'm so
sorry to Owen!

The main parent component is App.js which is made up of six child components that all conect to
the backend through axios.

1. Login (Connects to UserController in backend)
2. Register (Connects to UserController in backend)
3. Add (Connects to SongController in backend)
4. Delete (Connects to SongController in backend)
5. Edit (Connects to SongController in backend)
6. List (Connects to SongController in backend)

When things were working the running process was through putting the backend repo files in HTDOCS 
of XAMPP and having the front end repo files in SRC of react app.
